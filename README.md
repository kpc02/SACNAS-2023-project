# SACNAS 2023 Project

## Overview
Kristine's project files for SACNAS project. This includes Python scripts for data analysis. The purpose of this project is to create a model that integrates photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from calibrated ship radiometer data to 15 meters at depth for Gradients 4 cruise. This workflow is intended to be reproducible for the rest of SeaFlo cruise data. To find the python notebook that helped make the figures found in the SACNAS poster, it can be found under SACNAS_poster_figures.
